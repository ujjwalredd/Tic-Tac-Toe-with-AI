# Tic Tac Toe with AI

This is a simple command-line implementation of the Tic Tac Toe game in Python, where you can play against an AI opponent. The AI opponent uses the minimax algorithm to make its moves, providing a challenging gameplay experience.

## Prerequisites

To run this game, make sure you have Python 3 installed on your system. You can download Python from the official website: [Python.org](https://www.python.org/)

## How to Play

* Clone this repository to your local machine or download the source code as a ZIP file.
* Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory. (cd path/to/Tic-Tac-Toe-with-AI)
* Run the game by executing the following command: python main.py
* The game will prompt you to enter the row and column numbers for your move. The board is a 3x3 grid, so valid row and column numbers range from 0 to 2. Enter the numbers as prompted.
* The AI opponent will then make its move. The game will continue until there is a winner or a tie.
* After the game ends, the final board state and the winner (if any) will be displayed.


## Customization

If you wish to modify the game or improve the AI's difficulty, you can make changes to the source code. The `main.py` file contains the game logic and AI implementation.
* To adjust the AI's difficulty, you can modify the `minimax.py` function in the code. For example, you can change the depth of the recursion or add additional evaluation heuristics.
* Feel free to explore and experiment with the code to enhance the game or implement additional features.
